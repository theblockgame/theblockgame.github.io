# Block Game

Go to https://theblockgame.github.io/ to test it!

This is a free time hobby project for myself. I was tired of ads in Tetris games and decided to make my own minimalistic game.

This game is implemented entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript without any additional libraries and it works both on mobile (touch gestures) and desktop (keayboard controls).
